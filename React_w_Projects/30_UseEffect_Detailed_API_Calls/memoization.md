- memoization
- caching
- Memoization is an optimization technique for accelerating computer programs by caching the results of heavy function calls and returning them when similar inputs are encountered repeatedly. Simply, React memoization is similar to caching.

- To over come they delay in functionality of larger code calculations memoization is benificial
- example fibonnaci

- useMemo
- Prevents from rendering if dependency is not changed
- to avoid lag or buffer due to high calculations
- memoization of callbacks function value is done.

- useCallback
- memoization of callbacks function is done.

- useMemo and useCallback are similar

- we can also memoize the component of react
