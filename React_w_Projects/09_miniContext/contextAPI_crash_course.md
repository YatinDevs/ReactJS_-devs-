# - What is Prop Drilling?

Anyone who has worked in React would have faced this and if not then will face it definitely. Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to requirements in the final level.

- So to Avoid Prop Drilling

# - ContextAPI --> associated with Pure React Only --> Doesnt Exist Outside React.

- There are Also other libraries outside React to Solve this Issue

# - State Management Libraries :

- 1 Redux - State Management -- Stand Alone Library.
- 2 react-Redux - In react we Have.
- 3 Redux-Toolkit(RTK) -- Easier Version of Redux.
- 4 Zustand.

# ContextAPI :

- Its Library and not a FrameWork.

- Steps to Use ContextAPI :
- 1. Create Context
  - import and Create the ContextAPI.
  - React.CreateContext();
- 2. export it .

- Each Created Context gives Provider.
